United States,3.6,"Source: Numerator: HIV prevalence was estimated from cumulative HIV incidence using an extended back-calculation model (using both HIV and AIDS data, the time of first diagnosis with HIV, and disease severity at diagnosis) and estimated cumulative deaths.  The data can be accessed at: http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/surveillance_Report_vol_19_no_3.pdf. Denominator: The estimated PWID population was derived from three nationally representative surveys that provide data on same-sex behavior.  Data for lifetime history of injection drug use were combined using meta-analytic procedures.  The proportions of men and women who had ever injected drugs were applied to 2011 U.S. census data for persons 13 years of age and older to produce a population size estimate.  A report describing the methods used to estimate the number of PWID can be found at: Lansky A, Finlayson T, Johnson C, Holtzman D, Wejnert C, Mitsch A, Gust D, Chen R, Mizuno Y, Crepaz, N. Estimating the number of persons who inject drugs in the United States by meta-analysis to calculate national rates of HIV and hepatitis C virus infections. PLOS One 2014; 9(5): e97596."
